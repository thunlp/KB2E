Data
==========

We provide FB15k and WN18 datasets used for the task link prediction in data.zip, using the input format required by our codes. The original data can be downloaded from:

FB15k, WN18 are published by "Translating Embeddings for Modeling Multi-relational Data (2013)." [[Download]](https://everest.hds.utc.fr/doku.php?id=en:transe)

FB13, WN11 are published by "Reasoning With Neural Tensor Networks for Knowledge Base Completion". [[Download]](http://cs.stanford.edu/~danqi/data/nips13-dataset.tar.bz2)

New York Times Corpus: The data used in relation extraction from text is publish by "Modeling relations and their mentions without labeled text". The data should be obtained from LDC (https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2008T19) first.

FB40k [[Download]](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1c0xrtVa)

Datasets are required in the folder data/ in the following format, containing six files:

+ train.txt: training file, format (e1, e2, rel).

+ valid.txt: validation file, same format as train.txt

+ test.txt: test file, same format as train.txt.

+ entity2id.txt: all entities and corresponding ids, one per line.

+ relation2id.txt: all relations and corresponding ids, one per line.

+ e1_e2.txt: the top-500 entity pairs which are calculated by TransE.  [[Download]](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1c2iLtmg)

Code
==========

The codes are in the folder TransE/, TransR/, CTransR/.

Compile
==========

Just type make in the folder ./

Training
==========

For training, you need to follow the steps below:

TransE: call the program Train_TransE in folder TransE/
	
TransH: call the program Train_TransH in folder TransH/

TransR:

+ Train the unif method of TransE as initialization.

+ Call the program Train_TransR in folder TransR/

CTransR:

+ Train the unif method of TransR as initialization.

+ Run the bash run.sh with relation number in folder cluster/ to cluster triples in the trainning data. e.g., bash run.sh 10

+ Call the program Train_cTransR in folder CTransR/

You can also change the parameters when running Train_TransE, Train_TransR, Train_CTransR.

-size : the embedding size k, d

-rate : learing rate

-method: 0 - unif, 1 - bern

Testing
==========

For testing, you need to follow the steps below:

TransE : `./Test_TransE bern`.

TransR: Call the program Test_TransR with method as parameter in folder TransR/

CTransR: Call the program Test_CTransR with method as parameter in folder CTransR/

It will evaluate on test.txt and report mean rank and Hits@10.
